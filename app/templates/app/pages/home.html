    <p>
        Welcome to the website of Levi Stoddard! This is the website where I am going to showcase all of my projects and perhaps even a few blog articles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: This website is largely out of date since school. I hope to tend to it soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer at Keysight Technologies in Everett, Washington.
        Previously, I was a computer science student at the University of Washington Bothell. I've been programming for about nine years and I love it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I program some more, invest (stocks, options, futures oh my!), learn lockpicking and hang around my unusually large family.
    </p>

    <h1> about this website </h1>
    <p>
        This website is built using the django library because I like python and
        hosted on pythonanywhere because the free service is sufficient for my
        needs and extremely easy to use (I set up the django project on my computer,
        pushed it to GitHub, pulled it from GitHub on their website, changed a few files and done!).
    </p>
    <p>
        I also created my own django template tag which allows me to show highlighted code like this file which creates registers the tag itself
        {% pygment_code 'python' %}
from django import template
from django.template import Context
register = template.Library()

from pygments import highlight
from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter


class PygmentCodeNode(template.Node):
    def __init__(self, content, code_language):
        self.content = content
        self.code_language = code_language

    def render(self, context):
        # return the highlighted code with buttons which allow easy selection
        return '<div class="highlight-container">' +\
        '<button class="hide-lines-button"> toggle line numbers </button>'+\
        highlight(self.content, get_lexer_by_name(self.code_language, stripall=True), HtmlFormatter(linenos='inline')) +\
        '</div>'

@register.tag
def pygment_code(parser, token):
    try:
        # split_contents() knows not to split quoted strings.
        tag_name, code_language = token.split_contents()
    except ValueError:
        raise template.TemplateSyntaxError("pygment_code tag requires exactly one argument")
    
    if not (code_language[0] == code_language[-1] and code_language[0] in ('"', "'")):
        raise template.TemplateSyntaxError("pygment_code tag's argument should be in quotes")

    #strip the quotation marks
    code_language = code_language[1:-1]

    nodelist = parser.parse(('endpygment_code',))
    parser.delete_first_token()
    return PygmentCodeNode(nodelist.render(Context()), code_language)

        {% endpygment_code %}
